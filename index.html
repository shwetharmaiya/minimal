        <p> Lockdown unlocked opportunities for me. A happenstance with a HTML Course on Pluralsight led me to Web development. And I have been ever curious about web development since. It has been a wonderful journey so far. </p>

        <p>Shwetha worked on building me a social media website. She picked up Django pretty quickly and also managed to figure out legacy code, and did a good job implementing features. She also had a pulse on my requirements pretty quickly. I particularly liked how she took strong ownership of the project that she could think of ideas and discuss them with me unprompted. She is also very prompt with communication, and I always knew what was going on with her work even if I was busy elsewhere. She is dogged in chasing down bugs, doesn't hesitate to do whatever it takes to implement a feature, and takes to new libraries and techniques quite easily. It has been a joy to work with her. - Priya Venkateshan </p>
        
        <p>Shwetha inspires me with her ability to learn things with great interest and pace. While being proficient with various other web development technologies, Shwetha embarked on a voluntary project to develop aayurarogyam.com , and picked up WordPress and WooCommerce concepts in no time!  Her work on the project has touched many farmers, local artisans, and sellers of traditional specialities, in Chennai, and to the hundreds of discerning customers of the website too! It was my pleasure to co-volunteer and assist with the project, with Shwetha! - Nagesh Pai</p>

        <p>There was on a urgent need to bring up a website to market our villagers made products who were hit hard due to covid and lockdown.Shwetha volunteered herself to design a wordpress website with mentoring of another WP expert as a probono task. Thanks to her quick learning and go getter attitude. We Found Shwetha as an great collaborator, Enthusiastic Problem Solver, Go getter who exhibits utmost commitment and professionalism in all her actions.. she gives her best to position herself as great asset to the team she contributes.
